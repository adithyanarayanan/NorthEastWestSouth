Some blog posts related to deploying apps that involve getting data from twitter stream:

https://towardsdatascience.com/complete-guide-to-build-and-deploy-a-tweet-generator-app-into-production-5006729e583c
- this is not exactly about getting live streams, but touches upon the issues of handling models of large sizes, and such issues on cloud.

https://medium.com/datareply/realtime-streaming-data-pipeline-using-google-cloud-platform-and-bokeh-9dd0cfae647a
- this is somewhat closer to our usecase, although the processing is not as intensive.

https://syntio.net/en/labs-musings/streaming-data-from-twitter-to-gcp
- this is again a related, but not very relevant post. I am just dumping here for future reference.

- okay, may be we don't have exact same thing in mind, but check this out. useful stuff.
