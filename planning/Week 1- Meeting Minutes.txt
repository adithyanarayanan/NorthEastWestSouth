Meeting Minutes from Meeting 1

- Project idea: a Twitter feed based news aggregator where you collect news articles from official handles of media outlets, and
a) group them by topics (the topic modeling library I mentioned is this: https://github.com/D2KLab/tomodapi/)
b) show the general reader sentiment about these articles
c) for V2: add more features such as toxicity level, partisan-ness etc)

- How we work: We meet once a week on Tuesdays at 2 pm. We can have an e-mail check in perhaps on Fridays if it is alright for you. Before our weekly meeting, if you can send a PR on github for that week's work (giving me enough time to review - so may be by Monday evenings?), that would be good. We can have additional meetings during the week if you have something and want to meet during that week. 

Rough plan: (We can plan specifics in Weekly meetings)
Weeks 1--3: Data collection setup + general planning
Weeks 4--6: Topic modeling, sentiment detection etc. (+ how to keep it going i.e., training every 2 days or some such frequency)
Weeks 7--10: Deployment options, testing stuff etc.
Weeks 11-12: Wrap up, Blog posts, Resume review, interview prep etc. 

TODOs for Week 1: 
Adithya
 - setup the github project based on the structure from Cookie Cutter Data Science (https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science), having folders for code, readings, weekly notes, reports/notebooks, visualizations etc. (whatever you find appropriate. I can add once I get access - nishkalavallabhi is my github id).
- Start looking at data collection from Twitter (identify the handles, figure out how to get all posts in a thread about an article)

Sowmya:
- Take a look at the github repo and add some notes to it. 
- Look for examples of how people deploy apps involving streaming data and stuff on heroku/google/aws etc.
- May be start a resources/readings folder in the github project to compile some useful readings/projects related to this topic.
